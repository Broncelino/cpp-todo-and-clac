# Overview

My name is Bryson Williams I have always loved computers and have been programming for a few years now.
I've already made other programs in various languages and have them 
posted to this github. As of now 9/17/22 I am aiming to become a Database admin or something else in that field.
Being able to pick up new programming languages is critical to starting to work in the computer science industry.

My program is has a todo list maker and a basic physics equation calculator that loops
until the user doesn't want to use one anymore.

I wrote this code to teach myself the basic lalyout of c++ and its syntax.


# Development Environment
I used Microsoft Visual studio on my desktop and laptop.
The langauage used is c++ with deque and string added on top of
the original c++

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* add more and more complex equations
* Write the todo list to a file
* have the starting todo list be read from a file.
